# private-information-server

Store your private information in this server rather than inputting directly into apps like Insomnia - This ensures you don't accidentally export and share your private info.

# Windows Shortcut

Create a Windows shortcut

Target: C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /c npm run start
Start in: Your project dir
Run: Minimized

Pin this to your task bar.

Note: /c closes on completion, /k will keep it open
It's a live server so it doesn't really matter in this case.

Google image search with: filetype:ico to find an icon for your shortcut.
